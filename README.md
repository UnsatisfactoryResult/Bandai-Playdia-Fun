# Bandai-Playdia-Fun

I have added a capacitor map. There are a lot of caps in the playdia.

Here's a convenient DigiKey list I made. Chemi-Con KMG series make up the vas majority. There are a few oddball ones that I had to tap Nichicon, Panasonic, and Rubycon for. 0.1uF electrolytics seem to be on the out, but I did include one that has a few thousand in stock even though it's obsolete.

Some of the power supplies are screwed together, and some are glued. Mine is glued, and I don't plan to use or cut it apart at this point, so I'm not sure what cap is hiding in there. Looking at pictures on Retrostuff's blog, it looks really small for some reason. I can't see any of the details though.

I also added an IC map and datasheets. I was able to find datasheets for all the ICs except the audio/video processor surprisingly.
