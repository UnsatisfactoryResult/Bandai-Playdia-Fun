# Bandai-Playdia-Fun

I have added a capacitor map. There are a lot of caps in the playdia.

Here's a convenient DigiKey list I made. Chemi-Con KMG series make up the vast majority. There are a few oddball ones that I had to tap Nichicon, Panasonic, and Rubycon for. 0.1uF electrolytics seem to be on the out, but I did include one that has a few thousand in stock even though it's obsolete.

Some of the power supplies are screwed together, and some are glued. They use different brand capacitors, but the same ratings.

If you'd like to replace the original Japanese power supply with a modern US one, I'd recommend the Triad Magnetics WSU090-1300. This offers a few hundred mA of headroom over the original.

I also added an IC map and datasheets. I was able to find datasheets for all the ICs except the audio/video processor surprisingly.
