# Bandai-Playdia-Fun

I have added a capacitor map. There are a lot of caps in the playdia.

Some of the power supplies are screwed together, and some are glued. Mine is glued, and I don't plan to use or cut it apart at this point, so I'm not sure what cap is hiding in there. Looking at pictures on Retrostuff's blog, it looks really small for some reason. I can't see any of the details though.

I also added an IC map and datasheets. I was able to find datasheets for all the ICs except the audio/video processor surprisingly.
